# Natsumi-Tweaks for Cohesion
Natsumi has a lot of slick custom styles, and many of them need to be adapted to work properly with Cohesion.

## Install and Config
- Drop the Natsumi-Tweaks folder into your **chrome** folder
- Add `@import "natsumi-tweaks/natsumi-tweaks.css";` to the top of your userChrome.css file

### Add these options in `about:config`

*(These need to be manually created, they aren't present by default)*

- `natsumi.sidebar.blur-zen-sidebar` = `true`	
- `natsumi.sidebar.containers-no-inactive-border`	= `true`	
- `natsumi.sidebar.enable-tab-groups`	= `true`	
- `natsumi.theme.clip-path-force-polygon` =	`true`
